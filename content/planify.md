description: A nice little project idea I came up with

Yesterday, I had an idea for a project that I could actually benefit from. 

It wasn't anything TOO crazy, but I figured it would be a good way for me to experiment with new technologies to make it.

I was just going to make a virtual planner, that's all. Initially, I instantly thought a website would be a good idea. I wanted to branch out to different web frameworks and get a bit of experience with ones other than NextJS, so I thought Vue would be a good choice. 

Of course, there were definitely some issues with this idea.

The main issue was that I needed a database to store information for each user (mainly all the things they have scheduled in their planner). However, databases seem to cost some form of money (whether it's hosting or actually having space). I needed some way to store user's information for free, and after a while I came up with the idea of making it a desktop application, rather than a web application.

Essentially, instead of storing all their scheduled tasks in a database, it would store it on their computer (maybe in some json file).

Of course, this isn't the best solution (mainly because their data will only be stored on one device only) but at least I can go forward with the project.

I'm going to be using Electron to make the desktop app, along with Vue and Typescript. My only concern is performance issues, because Electron tends to take up a lot of resources.

I'll be sure to post updates on how everything goes!
